# Magic101V2

Magic101 was the very first project of the year it was meant for us students to get refamiliarized with Java and intellij our requirements for this project included at least having five object classes 1 parent and four children classes while having a driver for each. Great way to begin the school year and I'm really gonna miss this class.
